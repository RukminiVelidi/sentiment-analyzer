End-to-End Sentiment Analysis Web Application
A full-stack web application that performs real-time sentiment analysis on user-provided text. The project features a modern frontend built with HTML/Tailwind CSS and a powerful Python backend powered by a custom-trained Scikit-learn machine learning model served via a Flask API.

Features
Real-Time Predictions: Instantly analyze text and receive sentiment predictions (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

Confidence Score: Each prediction is accompanied by a confidence score, indicating the model's certainty.

Intelligent Neutral Handling: The application intelligently interprets low-confidence predictions from the binary model as "Neutral," providing a more robust user experience for nuanced text.

Interactive UI: A sleek, modern, and responsive user interface with an animated background and loading states.

Full-Stack Architecture: Demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow, from model training to API deployment and frontend integration.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)

Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-CORS

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib

Environment: Python Virtual Environment (venv)

Local Setup & Installation
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer

pip (Python package installer)

1. Clone the Repository
   First, clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/sentiment-analyzer.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/sentiment-analyzer.git)
cd sentiment-analyzer

2. Set Up the Backend
   The backend server and the model training process are managed in the backend directory.

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
   Install all the necessary Python libraries using pip.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: We will create the requirements.txt file in a later step)

4. Train the Model
   Run the training script to download the dataset and train the sentiment_pipeline.pkl model file. This step will take a few minutes.

python train_model.py

5. Run the Backend Server
   Once the model is trained, start the Flask API server.

python app.py

The server will start running on http://localhost:5001. You will see log messages in your terminal indicating that the server is active and the model has been loaded.

6. Launch the Frontend
   With the backend server running, open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by simply double-clicking the file in your file explorer.

The application is now fully running!

Pushing to Your Own GitHub
To push this project to your own GitHub repository, follow these steps:

Create a new, empty repository on GitHub.com.

Initialize a Git repository in your local project folder and push your code.

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all your files to be tracked
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add full sentiment analyzer application"

# Set the default branch name to 'main'
git branch -M main

# Connect your local repository to the one you created on GitHub
# (Replace the URL with the one from YOUR repository page)
git remote add origin [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
